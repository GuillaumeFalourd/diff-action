**first_file_path** | YES | ex: `path/to/file1.txt`
**second_file_path** | YES | ex: `path/to/file2.txt`
**expected_result** | NO | `PASSED` (default) or `FAILED`

### ‚òëÔ∏èüî¥ Workflow examples returning error

[![Diff Action Test (FILE Error)](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/diff-action/actions/workflows/test_file_error.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/diff-action/actions/workflows/test_file_error.yml)

```yaml
    continue-on-error: true # Remove if you want the workflow to fail when error
```
